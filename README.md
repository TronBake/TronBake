- � Hi, I’m @TronBake
- � I’m greener then green as far as scripts and coding is concerned,but im very much interested in learning. 
- � I’m a Millwright,which is an industrial mechanic, so I like to understand how things work and I like to get my hands dirty. Im no stranger to trouible shooting and im a pro at learning how NOT to do things
- � I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with testing and experimenting with making things do things that everybody else thinks is impossible or very unlikely
- � Ive managed to unlock and root a few phones from just smashing keys on the commandline for many nights in a row without reall ytaking the time to read how to do it. right now im stumped on my p20pro.Also I bought about a dozen used old data center GPUs nvidia K80s to try and learn how to make a miner as a first project involving piecing hardware together, and holy cow its way harder then I thought.Ive only fried 1 so far surprisingly
this is my first repo im just learning as I go, I loaded up on notepads and many colored pens and thriftstores around me are just loaded with books on computer subjects so im loaded up and about to dedicate as many monhes as I can afford to dedicate riding my savings into the ground. because for me this is all so new and interesting and fun
<!---you can reach me at tronbake@protonmail.com and I hope I can have something to bring to the table before too long. Cheers!
